# Multiplication-calculator
Calculates the product of two numbers


Create a program that finds the product of two positive numbers without using the multiplication
operator (*). The program should ask the user for the first positive number. The program should
then ask the user for the second positive number. The program should then calculate the product
of these two numbers without using the multiplication operator. The program should end by
displaying the product of these two numbers.
The program does not need to check if the user enters a negative number
